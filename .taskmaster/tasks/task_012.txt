# Task ID: 12
# Title: Official Document Management (Simplified)
# Status: not_started
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop functionality to generate individual official documents for public agencies using pre-defined templates with status control (Pending, Sent, Received).
# Details:
Implement a module that allows selecting a template, merging relevant data from the system (e.g., collaborator details, event info), generating the document, and tracking its status.

# Test Strategy:
Generate several types of documents using different templates. Verify that data is correctly merged into the templates and that document status can be updated and tracked.
