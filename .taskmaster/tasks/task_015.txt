# Task ID: 15
# Title: Data Migration Tool Development
# Status: not_started
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a robust tool for data import and cleansing from existing sources (e.g., spreadsheets) into the new system.
# Details:
Create a script or a simple UI for importing existing collaborator, school/location, and event data. Include data validation and cleansing rules to ensure data quality during migration.

# Test Strategy:
Test the migration tool with various datasets, including 'dirty' data, to ensure proper cleansing and successful import into the new database schemas. Verify data integrity post-migration.
