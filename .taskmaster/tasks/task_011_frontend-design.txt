# Task ID: 11
# Title: Optimize Responsive Design and Enhance User Experience
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize the responsiveness of all existing and new pages, enhance user experience on mobile devices, and ensure all components function seamlessly across various screen sizes. This task focuses on improving overall usability and preparing the system for future functionalities.
# Details:
Conduct a comprehensive optimization of responsive design across all implemented pages (Dashboard, List, Form) and components (Header, Sidebar, Table, Grid). This includes refining layouts at various breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure optimal display and interaction. Specifically, ensure the Sidebar transitions correctly to a drawer menu, tables adapt effectively to smaller screens (e.g., via card-list transformation or horizontal scrolling), and grids stack appropriately on mobile. Additionally, identify and resolve usability issues, particularly on mobile devices, to enhance the overall user experience and lay the groundwork for future feature integration.

# Test Strategy:
Manual testing using browser developer tools' responsive mode across standard breakpoints (e.g., 360px, 768px, 1024px) to verify layout integrity, prevent overflows, and ensure text readability. Conduct user experience testing, especially on mobile devices, to identify and rectify usability issues. Consider implementing automated visual regression tests for critical pages to prevent future regressions.
