# Task ID: 2
# Title: Authentication and User Management
# Status: not_started
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user authentication (login/password) and role-based access control for Admin, Coordinator, and Common User profiles.
# Details:
Integrate Supabase Auth, define user roles and permissions, implement secure login/logout flows, route protection based on roles, and session expiration after inactivity.

# Test Strategy:
Test login/logout for each user role. Verify that users can only access authorized routes. Confirm session expiration works as expected.
