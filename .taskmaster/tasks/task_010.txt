# Task ID: 10
# Title: Automated Payment Calculation Logic
# Status: not_started
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the backend logic to automatically calculate collaborator payments by cross-referencing allocation information, confirmed attendance, and event value tables.
# Details:
Implement an algorithm that retrieves collaborator allocations, checks their attendance status, and applies the configured payment values per function to calculate the total amount due to each collaborator.

# Test Strategy:
Provide a diverse set of test data (allocations, attendance, payment configurations) and verify that the calculated payment amounts match manual calculations precisely.
