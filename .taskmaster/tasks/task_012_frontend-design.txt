# Task ID: 12
# Title: Accessibility (A11y) Audit and Remediation
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Perform a comprehensive accessibility audit across the entire system, identify and correct all identified issues, and ensure compliance with WCAG standards.
# Details:
Conduct a complete accessibility audit across the entire system using automated tools (e.g., Axe DevTools) to scan all pages for violations. Systematically address and fix all identified accessibility issues. Ensure all fixes and existing components comply with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. Perform thorough manual testing, including keyboard-only navigation to ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields, modals) are focusable and operable. Test with various screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to validate the user experience. Verify proper focus management, especially in complex components like modals and dropdowns. Check for sufficient color contrast and the correct implementation of ARIA attributes where necessary. Document all implemented accessibility improvements and remediation steps.

# Test Strategy:
Integrate and run automated accessibility checkers (e.g., Axe) in the CI pipeline to prevent regressions and identify initial violations. Conduct a comprehensive manual audit using only keyboard navigation to ensure full operability and proper focus management across the entire application. Perform dedicated testing with common screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to verify content readability, navigation, and interactive element accessibility. Develop and utilize a detailed checklist based on WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines to systematically track and ensure compliance throughout the audit and remediation process. Maintain detailed records of identified issues, their severity, and the implemented solutions.
