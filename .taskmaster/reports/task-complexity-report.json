			"expansionPrompt": "Based on the requirements for Task 3: Collaborator Registration Module, expand it into the following subtasks. The goal is to create a complete CRUD system for managing collaborators using Next.js and Supabase. Ensure the subtasks cover database schema design, backend API logic with security, a comprehensive list view, a detailed multi-section form for creation/editing, robust data validation, and a safe deletion process.\n\n1. **Database Schema & RLS:** Design and implement the `collaborators` table in Supabase. Include columns for personal (name, CPF, etc.), contact (email, phone), and banking information. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure only authorized users (e.g., Admins) can manage data.\n2. **API Layer for CRUD:** Implement the server-side functions or client-side Supabase calls to handle Create, Read (all and single), Update, and Delete operations for collaborators, respecting the RLS policies.\n3. **UI - Collaborator List Page:** Develop the UI to display a list of all collaborators using a Shadcn data table. Implement features for pagination, searching by name or CPF, and filtering. Each row should have action buttons to navigate to edit or trigger deletion.\n4. **UI - Collaborator Form (Create/Edit):** Build a reusable form component for both creating and editing collaborators. Structure the form into logical sections (Personal Details, Contact Info, Banking Info) using Shadcn components like `Card` and `Input`.\n5. **Form Validation & State Management:** Integrate Zod for comprehensive client-side and server-side validation. Create schemas to validate all fields, including a custom validator for Brazilian CPF and banking details. Manage form state, API loading/error states, and provide user feedback with toast notifications.\n6. **Implement Delete Functionality:** Add a delete action that triggers a Shadcn `AlertDialog` to ask for user confirmation before permanently deleting a collaborator record.",
			"reasoning": "The task is of medium complexity (6/10) as it involves a full CRUD lifecycle, which includes database schema design, backend logic with security (RLS), a multi-section frontend form, and complex, specific data validation (e.g., CPF, banking details). While it follows a standard pattern, the number of components and the need for robust validation and security add significant effort compared to a simpler CRUD task. Breaking it into 6 subtasks allows for a clear separation of concerns: database, backend API, list UI, form UI, validation logic, and the delete workflow."
